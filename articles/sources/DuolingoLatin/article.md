For years, countless teachers, students, and Classicists have been calling for the inclusion of a Latin course on the popular language-learning platform, Duolingo. After significant work, collaboration, and testing by dozens of members of The Paideia Institute, a Classics organization focused on making Classics more accessible and immersive, the Phase 3 Version (Final Public Version) of Duolingo Latin was finally released in September of 2019.

Duolingo is a well-designed, professional website and app, meant to make the learning process for languages a lot easier. Before students begin the course, they set their goal, a measure of how many minutes per day they would like to train for (make sure this is realistic, or else the infamous Duolingo owl will haunt your notification center), and they set up their Duolingo profile, giving them the option to take courses in other languages simultaneously or later on. It organizes its courses by creating a series of “language trees” (<em>linguae arbor</em> in Latin), which map out a student’s progress path and their future lessons. Additionally, it provides a variety of methods to show a student’s achievements and progress (i.e the “crowns,” “fires,” “hearts” above measuring achievements and the “friends leaderboard” below (the shield) keeping things competitive between your friends), making sure that the learning process is motivating, rewarding, and exciting. There are friend options, and you can create a leaderboard with them to see who has practiced and learned the most! In the first “language tree,” students are exposed to many different forms of several hundred words in complete sentences.

There are a wide variety of sentences, ranging from sentences about peacocks to Latin greetings (salve!) and nuggets of ancient Roman culture. These cultural references included in the course— interesting Roman foods (cibus) or mythology (dei), to name a few—provide a welcome contrast from the hard work of learning Latin for the first time! Each lesson includes vocabulary, composition, and even listening practice! In a typical Latin class, students don’t begin learning composition until they’ve covered a significant portion of grammar, and they don’t begin learning how to listen and engage with spoken Latin until...never! By combining these three primary components: vocabulary, grammar, listening, Duolingo Latin creates a revolutionary approach to teaching Latin, one that immerses the student completely within the language that they are learning. This is a process that has been used for years in modern language classrooms, but it has never found its way into Latin classrooms, likely due to its “unspoken nature.”

Although there are still only a “few” lessons available so far (in comparison to other popular languages such as French, Spanish, etc.), many Latinists are still working hard, developing and testing new “language trees.” Duolingo Latin is one of the largest Classics projects in 2020, and it is a tremendous way for a new learner to venture into Latin.
