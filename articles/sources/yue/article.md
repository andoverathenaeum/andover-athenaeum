Pythagoras (c. 570 BCE - c. 490 BCE), the famous Greek mathematician, philosopher, and founder of the Pythagorean brotherhood, had a profound impact on the development of mathematics and Western philosophical thinking. His name has been immortalized in mathematical literature, and he is viewed as a master mathematician and scientist. But who really was Pythagoras and what did he do?

Born in Samos, an island in Greece, Pythagoras left for southern Italy around 532 BCE. Unfortunately, none of his own writings have survived, so it is difficult to separate his own work from that of his followers, since those in his brotherhood would often cite Pythagoras' authority. The exact details of the lives of Pythagoras and his followers remain lost to history.

However, there are a few details that historians have gathered about the Pythagorean brotherhood. For example, they had many, some outlandish rituals, such as refraining from speaking about the holy, wearing white clothes, and even not touching beans! The Pythagoreans also viewed numbers in a very special way. First, they treated numbers as actual nouns, as we do now: for example, "three" refers to an actual entity and isn't just an adjective for "three stones." Second, they had the vision in which every quantity could be rewritten as a ratio of two whole numbers: for example, $1.5$ can be rewritten as $3/2$. $1.5$ is not so much a number as it is a relationship between $3$ and $2$, the same relationship that is between $6$ and $4$.

Yet perhaps the most famous contribution of the Pythagoreans is their Pythagorean Theorem. It is unclear whether or not Pythagoras himself proved this fact, and there is evidence of its use before his time by the Babylonians. Nonetheless, the theorem has been named after Pythagoras and states that in a right triangle with legs of length $a,b$ and hypotenuse of length $c$, we have $a^2+b^2=c^2$. However, in Pythagoras' time, algebra had not been invented, so the theorem would've been stated something like what follows:

<c><em>
"The area of the square built upon the hypotenuse of a right <br/> triangle is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares upon the remaining sides."
</em></c>

In particular, the sum of the areas of the yellow and red squares equals the area of the green square in the diagram above. This can be proved in a pictoral way as shown below. The red square, yellow square, and four blue triangles in the first diagram fill the same area of the green square and four blue triangles in the second diagram, so the sum of the areas of the red and yellow square equals the area of the green square.

This theorem posed a great threat to the Pythagorean concept of numbers, since it shows the existence of irrational numbers, those which cannot be written as the simple ratio of two whole numbers. According to legend, Hippasus of Metapontum (ca. 470 BCE) was drowned at sea by the Pythagoreans for spreading knowledge of the irrationals.

Consider a right triangle with both legs of length 1. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the area of the square built upon the hypotenuse is 2, so its side length is $\sqrt{2}$. Today, we would write a proof for the irrationality of $\sqrt{2}$ as follows: suppose for the sake of contradiction that $\sqrt{2}=\frac{a}{b}$ for relatively prime integers $a,b$. Then squaring and rearranging gives
\[2b^2=a^2\implies a\text{ is even},\] since the left hand side is even so the right hand side must also be. However, then the right side is divisible by $4$, so $b^2$ is divisible by $2$, meaning that $b$ is also even. This contradicts the assumption that $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, so $\sqrt{2}$ must be irrational.

But remember, algebraic tools were not yet invented at that time. Besides, that argument is rather complicated. Here's a simpler argument, which could have actually been developed at the time:

Suppose we scaled $1$ and $\sqrt{2}$ to side lengths which are both whole numbers, simplified as much as possible. Since the areas of the identical orange squares sum to the area of the green square, this means that we can divide the green square down the middle, and each half will have an area equal to the area of one orange square. However, if you can divide a square down the middle one way, you can also divide it into quarters, as shown. Therefore, each half, which corresponds to each orange square, can also be divided in half, so the orange squares can also be divided in halves. This is a contradiction, then, since the side lengths are no longer in simplest form, as they are both even.

This fact, called the incommesurability of certain lengths, spelled the demise of the naive Pythagorean view of numbers. Today, our view of numbers has expanded beyond even the rationals and irrationals to the complex numbers, and perhaps even quaternions.

It's fascinating how, without any tools of algebra or even the knowledge of the number 0, the Pythagoreans were able to state and prove this beautiful fact about right triangles that's still used today in fields like geometry, physics, and engineering.
