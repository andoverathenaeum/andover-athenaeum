At the age of 40, Jonathan Shay, a merited neuropathological and sociology academic, had suffered from a stroke, which almost ended his life. In a miraculous turn of events, however, Shay woke from his vegetative state. Having received a B.A. from Harvard University and an M.D. and Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Shay had built a foundational career in his medical research. He had his own laboratory in Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) where he studied the biochemistry of brain cell death. Despite years of laborious education and meritable excellence, Shay would end up turning away from his successful career. After his awakening, he was seemingly reborn into a completely new career.

Recovering from his stroke, Shay encountered what would turn out to be his second life’s work and passion...

<h4>
A Transition
</h4>
Devouring through Homer’s <em>“Iliad”</em> and <em>“Odyssey”</em> as well as works of other ancient writers, Shay became intrigued by the authors of ancient Rome and Greece. From the great thinkers of Athens to the eloquent orators of Rome, Shay discovered a vast, ancient world that, despite being buried thousands of years into history, would lead him to help countless veterans today to cope with their war experiences.
Amid his recovery period, Shay occupied a temporary position as a psychiatrist at the Department of Veteran Affairs Clinic in Boston. Inspired by the veterans suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder that he met and worked with at the clinic, Dr. Shay decided to continue treating veterans for twenty more years as a staff psychiatrist. In the midst of his newfound captivation with the classics, Shay saw reflections of the warriors of ancient literature in the veterans at the clinic. The doctor  turned to using his connections of great ancient literature to relate to those impacted by the psychological trauma of warfare.

<h4>
Dr. Shay and His Work
</h4>
Shay worked as a clinical psychiatrist for war veterans and treated them using comparisons to Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey. He explains how and why he converted into his new line of work in an interview with the MacArthur Foundation: “The veterans kidnapped me. They saw something in me that I didn’t see in myself, and they truly redirected my life.” Shay’s ardent, sincere, and benevolent connections to struggling veterans have been praised by many. In 2007, Shay was awarded a MacArthur Genius Grant Fellowship. In addition to serving at the Department of Veterans Affairs and Outpatient Clinic in Boston, he was the former Chair of Ethics, Leadership, and Personnel Policy in the Office of the U.S. Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel from 2004 to 2005. In 2009, Shay was the Omar Bradley Chair of Strategic Leadership at the US Army. Shay’s writing has appeared in Nature, The American Journal of Physiology, Ancient Theater Today and Parameters: Journal of the U.S. Army War College. Dr. Shay’s full list of accomplishments can be found at <a href="https://www.macfound.org/fellows/837/">https://www.macfound.org/fellows/837/</a>.

Much of Shay’s work centers around stories of the Ancient World—epics of grand war heroes and adventurers imperiously battling their adversaries—whether it be Achilles in glinting armor standing above a dying Prince Hector or Odysseus fleeing from the infuriated cyclops Polyphemus. Shay works to draw out the reality of war and human emotion from these mythical stories. In the Veterans Affairs Clinic, he saw common themes in which the soldiers suffered from guilt for surviving, alienation  upon returning from war, and betrayal by others in  war. Shay emphasizes the social reality behind relationships in war, such as the relationship between a soldier and his or her leader. Essentially, Shay puts ancient literature in context with real life. By bringing innovative perspectives of classical literature to war veterans, he aims to bring emotional relief to those affected by war experiences and trauma.

<h4>
Achilles and Odysseus: Psychiatric Tools
</h4>
Shay has published two books—each corresponding with Homer’s two epics. The basis of his primary publications is founded in his own interpretation of the epics and, drawing from his life’s work, relating those interpretations to accounts of war veterans. His first book, <em>Achilles in Vietnam: Combat Trauma and the Undoing of Character</em>, published in 1994, compares the Vietnam War to the Iliad’s Trojan War. In the book, Shay equates the story of the great Achilles to the war experiences of individual veterans that he has worked with. He acutely observes the interaction between soldiers and their superiors represented in the epic. These observations are projected to the interaction between modern war veterans and their superiors such as those in the Vietnam War, hence the title. Achilles in Vietnam opened the door to veterans through the lens of one of the greatest works of classical literature.

Shay’s second book, <em>Odysseus in America: Combat Trauma and the Trials of Homecoming</em> published in 2002, associates Odysseus’s episodic adventures in returning home to Ithaca with those of war veterans. In Odysseus’s encounter with the Phaeacians, Shay points out the tension between those willing to fight and those unwilling to fight. When Odysseus’s crew becomes entranced by the pleasure-inducing lotus flowers, Shay points out the similarity to modern-day drug abuse with coping veterans. Connecting the epic with veteran stories and experience, Shay grounds the <em>Odyssey</em> in reality. Like its counterpart, <em>Achilles in Vietnam, Odysseus in America</em> is a therapeutic tool for war veterans, just through a different lens—one that comes from different narrative and storytelling perspectives. Shay puts the two great epics of Homer, the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>, and draws parallels from the extravagant, fictional legends to harsh, stone-cold reality. (An in-depth discussion of <em>Odysseus in America</em> is available on the Bryn Mawr Classical Review <a href="http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2003/2003-07-39.html">http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2003/2003-07-39.html</a>).

Stories are stories. Despite the often fantastical or unrealistic plot details, we can always find those connections in literature to real-life themes and events.  Dr. Jonathan Shay found reality in the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>, and through his work,  he has helped countless soldiers cope with their post-war struggles,  just as Homer once conveyed through his works.
