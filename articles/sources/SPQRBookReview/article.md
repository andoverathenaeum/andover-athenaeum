When I first decided to crack open this six-hundred-page volume covering the rise of the Roman empire -- from the mythical age of Romulus to the earth-shattering decree by Caracalla to extend citizenship to free men throughout the empire almost a millennium later -- I feared that Beard had bitten off more than she could chew. The period in question is so vast that it can be difficult to characterize without perusing over significant details; for comparison, think about the depth of American history in only a quarter of that time. Beard acknowledges the challenge herself in her introduction: “In some ways, to explore ancient Rome from the twenty-first century is rather like walking on a tightrope, a very careful balancing act. If you look down on one side, everything seems reassuringly familiar…On the other side, it seems completely alien territory.” Yet what appeared to be Beard’s greatest challenge turned out to be her greatest achievement. The history Beard presents sheds light on even the sometimes mundane, sometimes bizarre events of Rome as she interweaves contrasting primary accounts that span decades and modern archaeological evidence into a comprehensive narrative.

The title SPQR, which can still be seen inscribed on the manhole covers in Rome, sums up the main subject of the book concisely: the Senate and the Roman People, and more broadly, Roman identity. Beard examines the stories of Roman patriots and foreign barbarians with a particular attention to how the theme of imperialism was embedded in Rome’s earliest history. Beard argues that early Roman history should be interpreted as revisionism on the part of later historians than be accepted as fact. However, that doesn’t mean we should discard these stories, but rather recognize them as demonstrative of the constant altercation of what it means to be Roman. Beard continues to analyze Roman history with a critical eye as she transitions into the more well-documented Republican era as she continues to analyze how influential politicians reshaped the idea of civitas, or citizenship, and often left biased historical accounts in their wake. By the time of the empire’s height, it’s telling that men born in Spain and North Africa had ascended all the way up the cursus honorum to the position of emperor. What began as a collection of huts on the Tiber developed to encompass peoples far-flung from Rome; this sense of Roman identity would long outlast the actual collapse of Rome.

Beard’s thesis about Roman identity is concise and well-defended. It highlights the interconnectedness of Roman history and lends explanation to the aspects of Rome which seem “alien territory.” SPQR does suffer from moments of inconclusiveness, and those looking for a broad overview of Roman history will find themselves shaking their heads at most points. Nevertheless, Beard’s restraint from making assumptions is a testament to her scholarly approach to Roman history; do not open SPQR expecting a retelling of the works of Tacitus and Livy. To call SPQR a revisionist work in this way would be to miss her point entirely.

In equal parts as SPQR is scholarly, so too is it engaging. With a dash of English humor, Beard delights in poking fun at the Romans and in highlighting the modern aspects of Roman culture using comparisons that feel apropos -- she dedicates a small section to the significance of Roman bars in the greater class struggle. Not to mention, SPQR is an excellent source of Roman trivia. Beard is taking her audience on a tour through ancient Rome, highlighting all the important landmarks along the way as she begins to fit pieces of the puzzle together. She treats the Romans as living people, not to be scorned as insignificant or revered as sacred but rather to be understood as any living culture. Beard’s compelling and refreshing narrative is truly worthy of a spot on the shelf of any student of the Classics, and her personal voice, oozing through the text, will continue to inform and entertain future generations of students.
