<h>There are countless forms of popular media that focus on Classical themes, but very few utilize them as well for their own respective purposes as SPQR, Circe, and Plebs! Read the brief blurbs below and check out their reviews, excerpts, and clips online!

SPQR - Mary Beard ($14 - Amazon)

Featured by Jake Zummo ‘21 here in Andover Athenaeum, SPQR is a lovely read, bringing you up-to-speed on Rome’s history and culture, and how the unstoppable Roman Empire rose from a group of huts in the settlement of Alba Longa. As written by Natalie Haynes in The Guardian, “Beard’s study of the Romans is as scholarly as it is hugely readable.” SPQR is the perfect combination of traditional Classics combined with the modern lingo and relevancy that pushes it into the public spotlight.

Circe - Madeline Miller ($15 - Amazon)
</big></c>

Madeline Miller portrays Circe, the daughter of the sun-god Helios, cast as a wicked villain in Homer’s Odyssey, in a drastically different light in Circe. “A bold and subversive retelling of the goddess’s story,” Circe gives the backstory to her childhood practicing witchcraft and eventual banishment to the island of Aeaea by Zeus himself. Miller tells Circe’s previously hidden story, setting the stage for a powerful, ancient depiction of a woman fighting for survival in a male-dominated society. Miller fixes a prominent misrepresentation and demonstrates the importance of “showing the other side of the story.” Read more about Circe in Alexandra Alter’s review on the New York Times, “Cicero, a Vilified Witch From Classical Mythology, Gets Her Own Epic.”

Plebs - Netflix UK

Now, if you have the ability to find this show somewhere, whether it be on Youtube, with a VPN, or on some (cough) other sites, Plebs is a must-see TV comedy for anyone with a remote interest in Ancient Rome and what it was like “on-the-ground.” This show, following the story of Marcus, Stylax, and their servant Grumio, is a lovable, comedic fun-fest. Whether it be Marcus’s landlord greeting them with “Salve,” or the Saturnalia (the predecessor to Christmas) parties, Plebs has more than enough Roman culture to satisfy the average Classicist! With five aired seasons and a sixth in development, Plebs is the most unforgettable and binge-worthy TV comedy for lovers of Ancient Rome. You won’t want to miss the inappropriate but irresistible comedy, immersive Roman culture, and witty dialogue! Forget the aristocracy of Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey; watch the daily Roman lives of Marcus, Stylax, and Gromio!
