“There's no such thing as dead languages, only dormant minds,” and soon all minds may be dormant of Latin, proclaims Spanish novelist Carlos Ruiz Zafon. Based on an educational study, at the turn of the 20th century, 50% of the student population in the United States took Latin, but now in the 21st century, less than 2% of students take Latin.

Latin originated in Latium, which later became Rome. It was a vernacular language for the Romans, but after the collapse of the Roman Empire, Latin was no longer a native language anywhere. By the Middle Ages, Latin was a “learned language” for all political, educational, and religious affairs. Church services were conducted in Latin, contracts were written in Latin, and education included learning Latin.

Latin came to America during the Transatlantic Slave Trade through the Bible. As one of the sacred languages — Greek, Hebrew, and Latin — Latin continued to be taught to the different Christian settlements in America. In the 18th century, the ideas of classical philosophers, such as Plato and Aristotle, inspired the founding fathers of the United States.

Throughout the 19th century, Latin was a core class along with math, the sciences, and English literature. Freed slaves learned Latin, and Indigenous Americans learned Latin from missionaries. While Latin was only consistently studied by European elites, it was a unifying factor between all backgrounds of Americans. From the 19th century to the 20th century, Latin was critical for admissions into college and many professions including law and medicine. However, in the mid-20th century, government reforms began to hurt Latin programs. The National Defense Education Act of 1958 allocated federal money towards the science programs for the space race. It cut most of the funding towards Classical language programs as they seemed less necessary for scientific advancement.

Hence, only certain schools could afford to preserve their Latin programs. Public schools that were heavily reliant on government funding were impacted the most. Latin implied wealth, and the students of the language became homogeneous like in Medieval Europe. A Latin education had to be bought, and the language regained the reputation as being for “educated”, wealthy people.

Since the 1960s, schools have taught Latin in the exact same way. Most textbooks have not been republished for over 50 years, and they teach strictly in the grammar-translation approach. This method emphasizes memorizing grammar concepts during the first 2 years of Latin, and then applying the grammar concepts to long, dense translations from Latin to English in higher levels. It turns Latin into a “complex linguistic jigsaw puzzle that requires an elite mathematical mind to decipher,” according to John Bracey, a devoted instructor of the language.

Latin is superficially viewed as a language for intellectually advanced students because of the current grammar-translation teaching method. The author, Rachel Caine, in her novel, Glass Houses, wrote one of her fictional characters saying, “I thought all geniuses read Latin. Isn't that the international language for smart people?”. Solely students who can successfully memorize and reel off grammar rules can be successful in the current Latin curriculum, so it is much less attractive to most students. The current curriculum favors students who are talented at memorization although success in Latin is not based on this skill. Although a student may not be the best at memorizing, they could be successful in Latin, but this idea is beaten down by the current curriculum. In this way, Latin has become calculative and not linguistic. The teaching approach takes away the fluidity from the language. Only 30% of students take a second year of Latin, and only 15% of students return for a third, according to the aforementioned educational study.

Latin is also very exclusive, as it was in the past; private schools teach it more commonly, so students who can afford such education tend to be more exposed to the language. White students typically have the privilege to attend these institutions, so they majorly populate the language. The instructors of Latin are majority white as a result. Latin is associated with privilege, and the uniform race of teachers deter students of color from the language.

The diversity issue in Latin is partially due to historical precedent. The Romans were the first to take possession of Africans and bring them back to Europe as slaves. In addition, Roman history revolves around the glorification of European men. The language can be exclusive because it is so limited in its viewpoint. We cannot change this aspect of Latin. However, in a curriculum that supports diversity and inclusion, the language can evolve.

Latin programs in the United States are disappearing in a snowball effect, which is destroying the language. Because so few students take the language, there are fewer teachers and remarkably little funding. Schools can rarely maintain Latin programs. The presence of Latin in schools has been on a slow decline for the last half century. As there are fewer programs, fewer interested students, and fewer teachers, Latin could die a second, final death.

Latin has faced a decline in accessibility before; Latin was saved the first time by the founding of the colonies in America. The founders of the United States were strongly impacted by Roman history and the Latin language, so they pushed to conserve it. Latin is not just a beautiful language; it is fundamental. Students should learn Latin because it promotes the understanding of English grammar, and it grows the English vocabulary. Latin is an inflected language, meaning it does not use word order; therefore, it emphasizes the understanding of the different constructions of the parts of speech. In the same way it helps English, Latin helps conceptualize other Romance languages too.

Latin is a base for American law, and it is the foundation of our government. The origin and developmental history of Latin is rich, and it is important in European and American history. Furthermore, classical art and technology are revered in current creation today, and medicine and science use Latin to organize and classify. Our society revolves around the Latin language; in order for our government, art, history, science, and medicine to reach its fullest potential, the understanding of Latin is essential.

In recent decades, Latin has become unsustainable. We must change the teaching methods and curriculum of Latin to be more inclusive of all kinds of students despite socioeconomic class, measured intelligence, or race. The difference between Latin being a thriving world language or a forgotten dead language, lies in the students of the language.
