Any Classics student knows that their most handy tool in translation is a vast vocabulary. However, inexplicably, no matter how many Quizlet sets and vocabulary quizzes are taken, there always seems to be some words that escape our memory. In those moments, a powerful and precise dictionary is our best friend. There are countless Latin and Ancient Greek dictionaries and translators popping up on the web, and a modest amount of thick print dictionaries, but only a select few are worth using at all.

SPQR, an app available to both Android and iOS devices, is a multi-purpose Latin toolkit. The app consists of a Latin-to-English dictionary, English-to-Latin dictionary, and a Parser (giving you precise grammatical information). SPQR also provides access to dozens of famous literary works by authors such as Caesar, Cicero, and Vergil! Developed by Paul Hudson in 2016, an avid Classicist himself, who has created dozens of Classics-related applications, SPQR costs $6.99, but as you will see, its versatility and reliability more than makes up for the initial investment.

As you open the app, you are greeted by a Latin phrase/idiom/sentence. Below, there are five categories: “Home,” “Authors, “Dictionary,” “Grammar,” and “More.” If you press on the “Authors” page, you are led to a small list of famous Roman authors, and if you press on any one of them (in this case, Cicero), you are led to a short list of their most famous works. Pressing on one of these works, you reach the original Latin! Now, moving to the “Dictionary” page, you reach the aforementioned dictionaries and parser. Based on Lewis & Short’s Latin dictionary and William Whitaker’s online parser, these are SPQR’s hallmark features, providing quick, convenient, and accurate information. Next to “Dictionary” is the “Grammar” page, a lesser-known but equally useful tool that allows you to test yourself on various grammatical questions.

Finally, the last page, “More,” contains a group of fascinating tools:
<ul>
<li>“Flashcards” for self-testing,</li>
<li>“Learn” for learning grammar,</li>
<li>“History” for reading about Roman history, using Edward Gibbon’s famous work, “History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire”</li>
<li>“Quiz” for self-testing, </li>
<li>“Numerals” for learning Roman numerals, </li>
<li>“Typist” for writing, </li>
<li>“Pictures” for stunning photos of Rome and Pompeii, </li>
<li>“Gettysburg” for a Latin version of Lincoln’s famous Gettysburg Address,</li>
<li>“Access Controls” for control settings,</li>
<li>“Intro to SPQR” for a guide on how to use SPQR</li>
<li>“About” for a background on the development of the app</li>
</ul>

Ancient Greek, an app also available to both Android and iOS devices, is a nearly exact replica of SPQR but adapted for Ancient Greek students. Also having the similar works of Ancient Greek, Ancient Greek dictionary and parser, and Ancient Greek history books, Ancient Greek takes the same components that made SPQR so popular and transfers them to Latin’s predecessor. Developed by Paul Hudson and 2017 and costing $4.99, Ancient Greek opens with a famous quote from the likes of Sophocles, Aristotle, and Plato. If you explore the “Authors” page, you will find similarly famous authors of Ancient Greece such as Aristophanes, Euclid, and Herodotus. Here lies a vast collection of texts and pieces, easy to use and organized neatly into sections, chapters, and books. Next, Ancient Greek contains the exact same dictionary (no parser yet, as of 2020) based on Lidell & Scott’s dictionary (the exact same one sitting in Pearson A, if anyone has passed by it!). In order to allow students to type in Ancient Greek words, the English keyboard automatically transliterates Phonetic letters into Ancient Greek letters with a few special cases and keystrokes required. Finally, although Ancient Greek doesn’t have the additional features that SPQR has, there is still a history book called “Aunt Charlotte’s Stories of Greek History.” Don’t be fooled, as Hudson carefully notes in his introduction to the work, this is a well-written, well-connected, and certainly well-informed work that brings Ancient Greece to life!
