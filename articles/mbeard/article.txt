Mary Beard is not a typical Classics scholar. Her pungent frankness, biting sense of humor, and disregard for formality cut all stereotypes of classical academics and historians. Regarded as one of the most well-known and beloved classicists in the world, Beard has influenced many in her trademark personality and cerebral expertise of the ancient world. Beard teaches the public about modern politics and society by drawing parallels from the rich culture and history of Ancient Rome and Greece. It is doubtless that Mary Beard has significantly reshaped modern views of the Classics and the roles of women in ancient history.

Mary Beard and Her Work
</b>
Beard is a professor of the Classics at the University of Cambridge in England, where she is a fellow of Newnham College. One can read her professional profile at <a href="https://www.classics.cam.ac.uk/directory/mary-beard">https://www.classics.cam.ac.uk/directory/mary-beard</a>. A prolific and avid writer, she has written eighteen books and regularly outputs scholarly papers and book reviews. In addition to such scholarly mediums, she is a contributor to the <em>Guardian</em>, <em>Daily Mail</em>, <em>London Review of Books</em>, and Radio 4, a nationally recognized British radio station. Beard’s personal tone and style encompasses a wide range of audiences—from the heavily “popular-culture-based” <em>Daily Mail</em> to the more scholarly <em>London Review of Books</em>. In late March of 2020, Beard was appointed a trustee of the acclaimed British Museum. Despite being rejected from the museum for her pro-European views, she now occupies a prestigious chair in the reputable British Museum. Beard is also an active personality on social media, often taking to Twitter to express her political views and regularly interacting with strangers. Furthermore, Beard actively runs her blog, <em>A Don’s Life</em>, where she openly expresses her thoughts and tells accounts of her daily life. Having hosted nine TV shows, Beard has established herself as a popularized intellectual figure. According to a <em>TIME</em> magazine article, Beard has “gained a reputation for upending assumptions: that academics are boring and serious; that women on TV should be petite, blonde and under 35; and that public figures should ignore their online trolls.” Her novels and television appearances are platforms that disseminate her perceptive views and astounding classical knowledge across popular culture.

Views on the Classics
</b>
Declaring the root cause of her interest in the Classics, Beard states: “I wouldn’t work on Rome if I didn’t think it had something to do with the present. Why would you spend your life buried in the past?” (TIME). Mary Beard has introduced a fresh perspective on the Classics by seeing them from uncommon yet captivating perspectives. Beard is a storyteller: she elaborates on what the Romans and Greeks did and did not do. However, all that we know about the Ancient World comes from what the Greeks and Romans <em>told</em> us. Beard refers to this as their narrative, and her work predominantly explores <em>who</em> and <em>what</em> is excluded from that classic narrative, such as women, and <em>why</em> they get left out. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKWhJPyuQ5c">an interview with The Getty</a>, Beard discusses her view: “I think it’s a narrative with an added edge. If all one is going to do is repeat what the Greeks and Romans told you about themselves, well, better to leave it to them.” Beard attempts to expand the public’s understanding of the ancient world beyond what the ancients have distinctly written. In doing so, Beard primarily examines how the Greeks and Romans have changed the way we live today.

Beard’s books reflect the perspectives that she takes on the classics. In her 2007 book, “The Roman Triumph,” Beard discusses the concept of the Roman triumph, a distinctive military procedure which has taken on a more general definition. We see the Roman triumph as an extravagant ceremony for those having fought and won foreign battles. In her book, Beard considered the untold details of the ceremonies such as who set up the ceremony, who cleaned up the ceremony, and how spectators felt in the scorching sun or pounding rain. In “The Fires of Vesuvius: Pompeii Lost and Found,” written in 2008, Beard points out a few strange observations, such as the great amount of tartar in the skeletons’ teeth. This led to her ultimate deduction that Pompeii was a “city of bad breath” (<em>New Yorker</em>). Beard even discusses the role of humor and laughter for the Romans in “Laughter in Ancient Rome: On Joking, Tickling, and Cracking Up.” She explores what made the Romans laugh and their sensibility and sensitivity to humor. One can read more about Beard’s books in the New Yorker Article (<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/01/troll-slayer">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/01/troll-slayer</a>)

Addressing History’s Treatment of Women
</b>
The ancient Romans and Greeks were “irredeemably blokeish,” as Beard puts it (<em>Guardian</em>). Mary Beard, who has devoted her life to studying those ancient blokes, complements a female perspective into ancient studies with her feminist views. As an outspoken advocate for women, Beard has demonstrated countless examples of women’s oppression dating back to the ancient Greeks; in the <em>Odyssey</em>, for example, written around the eighth century BCE, the boy Telemachus urges his mother to weave upstairs, telling her that “her voice is not to be heard in public,” This moment, which occurs in a cultural landmark of antiquity, could not demonstrate any better the misogyny of ancient cultures. Other ancient authors seemed to follow a similar unfair and biased stance. Beard explains how in <em>Metamorphoses</em>, written by Ovid, a woman’s tongue is cut out so that she cannot denounce the man that raped her. In many of her eighteen books, Beard has included discussions of female perspectives and roles. Her book, “Women & Power: A Manifesto” traces misogyny and suppression of powerful women back to her areas of expertise: ancient Greece and Rome.

Beard explains, “If you venture into traditional male territory, the abuse comes anyway.” It’s not what you say that prompts it—it’s the fact that you are saying it.” Beard sets to eliminate such a mindset in today’s world. Although Beard is not a specialist in women and gender roles in ancient times, she continues to push against sexism with the mindset of a classicist. As a publicized figure, Beard serves as an unapologetic, intellectual, and audacious heroine for women outside and in her home country of Britain.

“What is the role of an academic, no matter what they’re teaching, within political debate? It has to be that they make issues more complicated. The role of the academic is to make everything less simple.”

“I do not love the Ancient Romans and Greeks, I don’t like them very much, but I think they’re extremely interesting and I think the world would be a worse place if we didn’t study them because we’d, obviously, miss great literature, we’d miss great history, but more to the point we’d miss a different way to see ourselves.”

“I wouldn’t work on Rome if I didn’t think it had something to do with the present. Why would you spend your life buried in the past?”

The Ancient World’s Reflection of Politics
</b>
Mary Beard is a contentious arguer. Beard has drawn comparisons with the ancient world to the current Trump era in the US, and though many have paralleled the political divide in the US to the fall of the Roman Empire, Beard has opposed such a comparison, stating that there is no Roman emperor who compares to Donald Trump However, with recent occurrences in politics such as Mitch McConnell’s shushing of Elizabeth Warren in 2017 or Donald Trump’s continuous mocking of Hillary Clinton in 2015, many have seen Beard’s views and connections on female empowerment reassuring.

Beard has used politics as a device in her unconventional teaching strategies. She previously had her students argue that the Soviet Union was more democratic than the UK and the US. Such an exercise had her students understand that the Soviet Union’s methods weren’t “barking mad,” but rather they were a “different set of criteria for assessing what was democratic” (<em>Guardian</em>). In a similar way in the ancient world, the Athenians called themselves democratic despite women not being able to vote. Beard continues to show how modern politics can relate to ancient politics and how views of democracy can be drastically different. One can read more about her teaching style in “The Cult of Mary Beard,” written by the <em>Guardian</em>.

Responses to Trolls and Critics
</b>
As expected of any popular figure, Mary Beard has received a great deal of criticism. In response to such criticism, Beard is atypical in her response. In her first appearances on television, Beard was attacked for her appearance. A.A. Gill, a British art critic, described her as too unattractive for television. With biting words, he elaborated, “Beard coos over corpses’ teeth without apparently noticing she is wearing them... From behind she is 16; from the front, 60. The hair is a disaster, the outfit an embarrassment,” as recorded in the New Yorker (<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/01/troll-slayer">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/01/troll-slayer</a>). Beard responded without hesitation to his comments by pointing that Gill was too intimidated by intellectual women and had no reasonable argument behind his attack.

Beard takes her trolls and critics head-on with her signature wit. With her prodigious presence on Twitter, Beard takes to social media as a break from her demanding academic work and writing. She has been known to take down online trolls and those who insult her with erudite counters, earning the title, “Troll Slayer,” coined by the New Yorker. She claims that she addresses such trolls with “aggressive politeness” (<em>TIME</em>). Her responses to criticism and trolls combine with her views of feminism and women: “It’s a great pleasure that I can show younger women that you can stand up to these guys. You can call them out. And life goes on.” Most notably, however, Beard has befriended many of her trolls. She even took one out to lunch and wrote him a reference for a job application. It seems quite odd that a celebrated academic befriended one of her detractors to such an extent that they developed a trusted relationship, but one must remember -- that’s exactly who Mary Beard is.

A Don’s Life
</b>
Beard maintains her blog, A Don’s Life, regularly, providing insight on current events. From discussing pineapples to addressing the COVID-19 outbreak, Beard never fails to entertain her readers with charming and witty writing. If one wishes to see Beard’s views on Boris Johnson and the classics or Prince Harry’s similarity to Emperor Tiberius, you can read her blog at <a href="https://www.the-tls.co.uk/categories/regular-features/mary-beard-a-dons-life/">https://www.the-tls.co.uk/categories/regular-features/mary-beard-a-dons-life/</a>.

Now 65 years old, Mary Beard is still active in her scholarship and writing. She continues to inspire and shape our understanding of the Ancient World and today’s world. Her unforgettable and signature aura and intellect deserve to be imprinted in history along with the ancient Romans and Greeks whom she studies.
