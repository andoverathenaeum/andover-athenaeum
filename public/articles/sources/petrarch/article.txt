Francis Petrarch was a prominent Italian scholar of the fourteenth century, who served as a bridge between the medieval era and the Renaissance. Born 1304 AD into a family of lawyers, Pertrarch’s early years of high-quality education gradually led to an exceptionally bright and inquiring mind as well as an unconventional love of classical authors. Such interests brought about his desire to search and transcribe forgotten ancient texts during his early adulthood, many of which were thoroughly analyzed and incorporated into his own writings. Constantly throwing himself into controversies against the “barbaric influence” of the Middle Ages, Petrarch additionally criticized the conservative teaching methods of the traditional universities and schools. Overall, Petrarch’s literary works and discoveries of classical texts were revolutionary to the medieval intellectual community, as such academic accomplishments prompted systemic changes to the classical education system.

Petrarch’s extensive collection of ancient Roman texts replaced non-orthodox medieval Latin instructions with original ancient writings, which influenced the traditional academic institution’s method of teaching Latin. During his early adulthood, Petrarch’s curiosity about the values and eloquence of classical figures took him to France, Flanders, Rhineland, and Brabant from 1333 to 1345 AD., where he visited monasteries in search of available ancient Roman manuscripts. Petrarch then stored the texts in Cardinal Colonna’s library at Avignon, which he generously shared with Boccaccio, the Medici family, and the general public after his death. Such abundant discoveries and increased spread of ancient Roman texts contrasted with the abrupt decline in the popularity of medieval Latin grammar textbooks, as the Black Death eradicated most authoritative Latin scholars of the era. Since major schools, including the University of Florence, also suffered from a lack of qualified instructors who could teach the content of the few remaining textbooks to young scholars, the leaders of institutions were forced to utilize Petrarch’s discoveries of Livy’s Ab Urbe Condita, Cicero’s Familiares, and Quintilian’s Institutio Oratoria. Thus, students of late-fourteenth century Europe mastered Latin through constant imitation, composition, and examination of original Roman writings, which was a significant improvement from the single-sided, syntax-based curriculum of the medieval era. Such an increased exposure to antique literature not only cast light on philosophies and writings that were forgotten for centuries, but also saved the study of the Latin language from extinction after the deadly plague.

Petrarch’s initial discoveries of ancient Greek philosophical writings additionally facilitated a renewed interest in incorporating Greek into the curriculum of the medieval education system. Though Petrarch’s knowledge of Greek was too rudimentary for him to comprehend the manuscripts of authors such as Plato and Homer, he acknowledged the profound impact that Greek literature brought to subsequent civilizations. For instance, after reading the writings of Plutarch that referenced Plato’s Timaeus and philosophical works, Petrarch visited Greece in an effort to acquire the specific texts that were mentioned. In hopes of further advancing his research on the Greek language, Petrarch also encouraged fluent Greek speakers including Boccaccio and Valla to continue re-examining Hellenistic texts and translating ancient theological books for the Royal library in 1341. As these followers of Petrarch eventually became influential classicists who wished to further comprehend the ideologies of forgotten Greek philosophers, the scholar’s emphasis on the mastery of the Greek tongue was thus able to rapidly spread itself across the medieval intellectual community. More importantly, Petrarch’s limited collection of Greek writings were supplemented by manuscripts from the weakened Byzantine Empire, as scholars Guarino and Aurispa returned to Italy with approximately four hundred pieces of writing at the start of the fifteenth century. With a solid foundation of Greek texts residing in all areas of Italy, Dal Fetre and other leaders of Italian academic institutions utilized these writings as introductory Greek textbooks for young scholars. In addition to the successful integration of Greek within the curriculum of prestigious institutions such as the Ferrara studio and Mantua school, the abundance of Hellenistic writings enabled small-scaled local academies to pursue Greek studies as well. Therefore, Petrarch’s encouragement for learning the Greek language led to an exponential increase in fluent readers throughout Italy, providing additional opportunities for medieval scholars to fully analyze and perceive primary documents on forgotten Hellenistic philosophies.

Another major contribution that Petrarch made to the medieval education system was shifting the emphasis of the curriculum from elementary logic to rhetoric and persuasion. Some of the texts that Petrarch discovered during his manuscript hunts included the speeches and Familiar Letters of Cicero, a prominent writer and politician of the Roman republic. Not only did Petrarch seek to imitate Cicero’s style of writing through publishing his own set of letters, but he also supported the ancient scholar’s belief that the purpose of acquiring knowledge was for the betterment of the masses. Expanding from this philosophy, Petrarch claimed that the intellectual’s role in society was to embrace active life in the service of the state, renewing the notion of the wise man being the adviser to the governing class. In reviving this secular ideal, however, Petrarch came to realize that the medieval academic trivium solely focused on elementary logic and dialectics. In his letter directed towards the supporters of traditional education, Petrarch expressed his concern by stating: “Even as nothing is more disgraceful than an old man just beginning his alphabet, so there is no spectacle more unseemly than a person of mature years devoting himself to dialectics.” Petrarch strongly argued that the mastery of dialectics did not contribute to productive political discussion and legislation whatsoever, thus being useless to humans. His claim resultantly urged Francesco da Carrara, the Lord of Padua, and other political leaders to foster their local universities with an increased emphasis on rhetoric, a more practical study of persuasion that ideally enabled educated individuals to properly guide the masses to prosperity. The influence of Petrarch’s ideology was further evident from the structural changes made to the University of Padua, as its intense studies of rhetoric led to the creation of the Universitas Artistarum in 1399, a separate department that solely focused on persuasion and philosophy. Through this comprehensive transition, Petrarch signaled a change in the purpose and content of education. Education was no longer reserved for the learned academics who isolated themselves from society; it was also for the ambitious who wished to actively participate in political life. Indeed, Petrarch’s emphasis on applying knowledge to politics undoubtedly contributed to the emergence of historical figures such as Coluccio Salutati, a prominent Italian scholar who also served as chancellor of Florence during the late fourteenth century. Thus, by advocating for the ancient idea of public service and duty, Petrarch helped create a completely new role for the intellectuals of medieval society.

In short, Petrarch’s innovative changes to the curriculum of the academic institutions produced a new group of scholars who sought to revive classical antiquity and involve themselves in state affairs, two major societal changes that were unprecedented within the medieval intellectual community. As such, Petrarch was a  multifaceted individual who challenged the validity of medieval European society in several different aspects, leading the Europeans scholars and theologians of his era to both the Renaissance and Protestant Reformation.
