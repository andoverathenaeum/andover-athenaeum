Brian Ko ‘19 was an ardent classicist at Phillips Academy, taking all the available Latin courses ranging from the introductory course, Latin 100, all the way to the Latin seminar, Latin 601-603 (and even skipping LTN 300 on the way there). After graduating, Brian has brought his experience and skills to Boston University (BU), majoring in political science and minoring in Classical Civilization.

We recently caught up with him and asked about his experience at Phillips Academy and his perspective, as an alumni, on the state of the Classics at Phillips Academy and in the wider world.

<h4>
I was wondering if you could give a brief biography about where you grew up, why you came to Andover, and where you are/what you're doing now?
</h4>
"I grew up in a small rural town in upstate NY, and there was not much to do around where I lived besides studying or sports. I was never a sporty person; even when I was quite young I’d stay inside as much of the day as I could, either absorbing myself in books or spending time with my little brother. So instead of practicing sports like other kids (and because of my race, I wasn’t like other kids), I focused on my studies. I devoted most of my time to studying, not really sure what I was even studying for. I didn’t really have any grand aspirations as a kid, I don’t think, just a hunger to learn. So I wasn’t really sure what to expect when I moved out from my small town after seventh grade, but I was eager to see. I moved to Andover that summer, unknowing at all that there was this big private high school in this seemingly tiny Massachusetts town. But I visited anyway and fell in love. The advanced pace of learning, the campus -- it was all amazing to me -- and I applied. The rest is history."

<h4>
Are you currently pursuing anything Classics related in college?
</h4>
"I am currently pursuing a Classical Civilization minor at BU, which focuses on how the language and the history interact to form the cultural background of the Roman Empire."

<h4>
How different is the level of interest and focus in the Classics at the college/university level versus the high school level? Is there a sharp difference in teaching style and types of students?
</h4>
"At college it’s surprisingly different. People at college, at least in the higher-level classes I’m taking, know a lot about the history, language, culture, etc. of ancient Rome and the Classical world. But at least in the environment I’m in, no one’s elitist about anything. I think Classics people are genuinely interested in their field and are happy to share that knowledge, which surprised me. Being a freshman in a Latin class mainly full of upperclassmen doesn’t seem to affect them much at all, in fact they were interested in what I had to say more often than not."

<h4>
Did you come into PA with the goal of taking Classics courses, or did you become interested after arriving?
</h4>
"It was honestly one of the reasons that I wanted to attend Andover in the first place: I took Latin a small bit in middle school and it was super interesting to me, so I wanted to continue it in high school. Andover had one of the strongest classics programs of the high schools I was looking at."

<h3>
<b>Favorite Figure in the Classics:</b>

"Ovid ... an exiled poet with a flair for the dramatic and controversial. I only wish I was able to translate him more in school."
</h3>

<h3>
<b>A Favorite Work of Latin:</b>

"The Aeneid. Although it’s a tad cliché, the story is seriously fantastic to translate and follow."
</h3>

<h4>
When you first came to PA, what was the state of interest in the Classics? I know you were the head of Classics Club, so how did you use the club to garner fresh interest in the Classics? When you graduated, had the state of the Classics at PA changed?
</h4>
"When I was a freshman at PA, I wasn’t too involved with Latin as a topic, but I know during my Upper year, when I really became involved with the club, there was almost no weekly attendance. Even when I was the head of the club, we did have weeks where nobody came. But I think that I left the Classics Club with an upward trajectory. There were very capable people at the helm, and while I think that the Classics Club can still be improved, it was a start. Latin doesn’t have the same unification as other languages do at PA, and if I could take some of the knowledge I’ve learned at BU and bring it back, I would."

<h4>
What was the best Classics-related experience you had at PA?
</h4>
"Probably the yearly declamation contests. Those were always fun to watch and occasionally participate in, both as a speaker and as a judge!"

<h4>
Favorite Classroom in Pearson Hall?
</h4>
"Probably Pearson A. Avoiding climbing up those huge stairs is the main reason."

<h4>
Have you ever visited Italy and/or Greece?
</h4>
"I’ve had the privilege of visiting Italy on a SYA Italy trip. It was a really fantastic experience, and I think the exposure to the cultural sites and the history really sparked my interest in Classics further."

<h4>
How has your Classics experience at PA changed you as a student and person and affected your life after PA?
</h4>
"Definitely working with Classics at PA has allowed me to be a bit more self-confident when participating in classes beyond Andover."

<h4>
After going through PA's Classics Program, what did you love and what did you want to change?
</h4>
"I definitely loved the close relationships built with teachers, and the ability to dive deep into the material, and I think I’d focus on building a better base and getting people early in their Latin careers interested in the historical material, as opposed to focusing so intensely on rote grammar."

<h4>
What is something that could take PA's Classics department to the next level?
</h4>
"Maybe this was just me, but I would support diving into intensive translation a lot earlier than PA’s current course does. The first two years of Latin are very grammar heavy, but I think most of the Latin grammar could be taught within the span of one year, and the year of LTN 200 could be spent on translation and stories."

<h4>
How do you think we can work to make more people interested in the Classics and bring down the "elite" status that the Classics carries?
</h4>
"I actually don’t think Classics is “elite,” more so it has an incredibly narrow niche. But I do believe that the Classics program at PA needs to get students interested earlier in great classical works, myths, and legends. Most of the classics students that I know, even in college, became interested in the language not because of the intricacies of its grammar structure, or because it’s the root of many Western languages. It’s because of the stories and poems and the rich history of the Roman empire. I think that if the PA Classics department can advertise more so the stories as opposed to the language, it’ll get students more interested."
Maybe it’s just my college, but Classics people are not elitist, nor are they too full of themselves. A lot of these people are genuinely interested in what their studies are dedicated to, and I think that finding a good, healthy community, whether Classics or otherwise, where people are able to share freely and discuss without fear of criticism, is something to be aimed for. It’s not exactly a story, but there are some great people in the world, and despite everything that may happen, the kinship that we share is key."

<h4>
How can students not taking Classics classes but are interested in the Classics also participate in Classics-related events and activities?
</h4>
"I definitely believe that some of the most non-Classics friendly elements of Classics are the stories and the poems. Stuff like the Aeneid, Catullus’ poems, etc., I think would be able to definitely attract a wider audience than just the Classics students. Sharing works like these, and discussing history, such as of the Roman Empire, could definitely be the way to cast a wider net. Though how to get STEM people interested in Classics beats me."

<h4>
Why are the Classics important today?
</h4>
"Classics are important today because of the history they tell. Classical Roman history is always a fantastic topic to deep dive into, and studying it through a modern lens is a great way to learn from the successes, and mistakes, of ancient rulers and people."

<h4>
Any favorite Classics jokes, puns, or idioms?
</h4>
"Nothing’s coming to mind right now, unfortunately. A lot of having fun with Classics are the inside jokes of groups you make."

<h4>
What do you miss most about PA?
</h4>
"Probably the green campus. While I absolutely love being at a city school, and I’m not an outdoor person by any means, being able to enjoy nature and see trees on campus, and to look across the lawn and not be bothered by sounds of traffic, could be nice."

<h4>
Favorite Quote?
</h4>
"'Despite everything, it’s still you.' – Toby Fox. It’s short and sweet and speaks to my personal philosophy of being your genuine self and being able to reconcile with who you are, no matter the circumstances, and to always strive for self-improvement."
