New First Steps in Latin is the first of a tremendous series of three Latin textbooks (First Steps, Second Steps, Third Steps). Each lesson utilizes charts, graphs, and vocabulary while also providing Latin-to-English translation sentences and English-to-Latin composition sentences. These lessons provide an organized, structured learning experience and allow for rapid growth and development while also making sure students have a comprehensive understanding of the Latin language. As described on their website, “For maximum learning efficiency, the texts employ minimum explanation of grammatical principles and instead concentrate on the essential grammar, morphology, and syntax of simple, compound, and complex sentences.” Succinct and clear at the same time, New Steps in Latin is perhaps the most convenient method of learning Latin and the fastest way to get to authentic texts!

Unlike the New Steps in Latin series, the JACT Introductory Greek Course is split into two books: “Text and Vocabulary” and “Grammar and Exercises.” These two books, as their names entail, give a comprehensive introduction to the language of Ancient Greek. After you learn the grammar and forms for each lesson in the “Grammar and Exercises” book, you will move to the “Text and Vocabulary” book where you will engage with authentic (or adapted) Ancient Greek texts from authors such as Aristophanes and Socrates as well as learn an abundance of important vocabulary. Together, these books create a fast-paced introductory course that will have you reading authentic Ancient Greek texts in short order!

If you complete these introductory courses or already have Latin and Ancient Greek experience, then you will want to begin reading authentic Classical texts, such as Virgil’s Aeneid or Homer’s Iliad. There is an abundance of online resources, but if you’re looking for sturdy physical copies, take a close look at the Loeb Classical Library Set. If you have wandered through any of the classrooms of Pearson Hall, you may have seen red and green books on some of the bookshelves: those are the distinctive marks of the Loeb Classical Library books. Marked with red for Latin and green for Ancient Greek, the Loeb Classical Library books are distinctive in that they are not only constructed of sturdy and lasting materials. They also have a unique interior, with the original text on one side and the English translation on the other. Thus, one can attempt to read the original text and use the other side as guidance or confirmation! Although they are on the pricier side ($20-30 per book), their utility and purity are well-worth the hefty price-tag! If you want to take a look at the set, visit Pearson A!
