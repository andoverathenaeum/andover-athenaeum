"Welcome to Alpheios, your resource for studying the world’s classical languages and literatures, including Latin and Greek!”

Alpheios is an open-source software that provides two main tools: a reading environment (on their website) for both Latin and Ancient Greek, and a free browser extension that allows a user to parse, translate, and understand any word in Latin, Greek, and many other languages! (On a side note, “Cave!” means “Beware!”; the meaning of the clever phrase should soon follow…)

According to Alpheios’s mission statement, “\[They\] aim to help people learn how to learn languages as efficiently and enjoyable as possible, and in a way that best helps them understand their own literary heritage and culture, as well as the literary heritage and culture of other peoples throughout history. [The]initial focus is on classical literature in languages no longer spoken, such as Latin and ancient Greek. The influence of these classics, like the river Alpheios, still runs like a subterranean stream deep beneath the contemporary world, as artists and thinkers continue to draw inspiration from them.”

The Alpheios reading environment, available on both mobile and desktop, contains dozens of major Latin and Ancient Greek works, ranging from Ovid and Caesar to Xenophon and Sophocles. To demonstrate, Alpheios’s user interfaces, having opened up Ovid’s infamous Ars Amatoria (“The Art of Love”), I am unfamiliar with the last word in the line, “amandi.” Double-clicking or double-tapping (depending on the platform), I open up a small pop-up screen that gives me its form (participle, either singular genitive or plural nominative or plural vocative), conjugation (1st), and definition (to love), which provides extensive information to help me continue my reading. However, if I wanted to know even more about this verb, I could press on the little message icon at the top of the pop-up and see all the dictionary-entry definitions for this verb. If I wanted to see this word used in other contexts, I would press the button to the right, which would bring me to countless other texts where “amandi” is also used. For some words, a treebank provides detailed descriptions of the syntax of text. It shows how the different words in the sentence are dependent on each other (e.g. which word is the subject, which is the object, etc.) These syntactical trees are not produced by Alpheios -- they can be made by anyone and linked to text! And to the right, a small magnifying glass implying a search feature allows me to search up any word I want, acting as a convenient dictionary.

Alpheios provides a seamless reading experience through its own reading environment, and their extension performs just as well. It contains all of the same features of their reading environment while allowing the flexibility of reading any other text on the web! The browser extension is turned off automatically so that when needed, all it takes is a simple click to activate it. Furthermore, all of Alpheios’s code is open-source, meaning that anyone can use their code for their own websites and projects, ensuring that Alpheios is open and accessible to everyone!

As this article is being written, The Alpheios Project, the developer project behind the creation of Alpheios, is branching out and completing unprecedented research and development. Not only are they planning on support other languages such as Persian, Syriac, and Hebrew, their “longer term goals include using the Alpheios platform to collect big data on how different individuals can best learn the historical languages (those without living native speakers) and appreciate their classical literature, and how this data can be interpreted neurophysiologically to shed light on human literacy and response to literature in general.”

Alpheios is an extremely powerful and useful tool that will help anyone, whether it be a Classics student amidst a difficult translation or  a casual student encountering  Latin or Ancient Greek words!
