Some of you may not know this, but every Wednesday at around 6:00 PM, a small group of passionate Classicists gather in Pearson A for Classics Club. Some weeks, we watch (and give!) brief presentations on various topics in the Classics such as aqueducts, Ancient Roman food/drink, and even Julius Caesar himself! Other weeks, we prepare for Certamen, a Classics Quiz Bowl Competition, or watch excerpts of Classics movies such as Gladiator and Hercules. There’s the occasional snack, but it is the common bond of curiosity in the Classics and the cozy but also slightly uncomfortable benches of Pearson A that makes these meetings special. It is a perfect time to engage and immerse oneself in the Classics without the exhausting rigor of Latin and Greek class.

In the past, Phillips Academy’s Classics Club was one of the largest and most influential in the Northeast (and the nation!) along with other boarding schools such as Phillips Exeter Academy and St. Paul’s School. But, as time passed and interest in the Classics as a whole waned, so too has our Classics Club. Along with the aforementioned schools, we once founded countless Certamen competitions, Classics conventions, and countless other events. However, while those schools’ clubs have remained stalwart in their commitment to extracurricular Classics, Phillips Academy’s Classics Club has become indifferent, mainly due to the lack of leadership in the middle portion of the 2010’s.

Nevertheless, under the guidance of departing Co-Presidents Axel Ladd ‘20, Alexandra Lebaron ‘20, and Gigi Glover ‘20, Classics Club has undergone a transformation, holding consistent weekly meetings and beginning ventures back into Certamen and rebuilding ties with our peer schools. The board has revolutionized meeting structures, building in several drastically different types (as mentioned above) to make every meeting exciting while also allotting time to pursue ambitious ventures such as Certamen and inter-school Classics.

With five carryover board members bearing the seniors’ legacy and with several new members joining the board this term, Classics Club has built strong, foundational leadership, both at present and for the future and is excited to begin its reinvention in the fall of the 2020-2021 school year. Our collective objective for the upcoming school year and beyond is to bring together not only those students who have a specific interest in the Classics but also those students outside of the Classical realm who simply have a curiosity into what makes the Classics so unique! It is this unification that will help bring down the wall around the Classics and make its fascinating world accessible and open to everyone.
