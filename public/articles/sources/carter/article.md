Having attended a public high school in Iowa with no exposure to the Classics, Ms. Carter discovered the rich world of Classics in college. At Grinnell College, Ms. Carter took one term of Latin in her fall of freshman year. After that term, she decided to stop before returning to Latin and soon became immersed within the Classics. Ms. Carter decided to learn Greek in the summer between her junior and senior years at Berkeley, and she spent the fall term of her senior year in Rome at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome, also known as the “Centro.” Deciding to pursue law, Ms. Carter attended the UC Berkeley School of Law and practiced for two and a half years before deciding she wanted to do something else. In her search for teaching jobs, Ms. Carter encountered a Classics teaching fellow opening at Phillips Academy. On September 11, 2001, Ms. Carter began teaching Latin at Andover. Soon after, Ms. Carter went to Boston University to get her Master’s degree in classical studies, and she has stayed teaching at Andover ever since.

<h4>
What do you like about teaching at Andover?
</h4>
“It’s a very fun job because working with Andover students is so rewarding. They work hard and they’re interested in what they’re doing. One of the things I like about teaching Latin 100 is the idea of being able to introduce kids to Latin in high school because it’s not offered at very many high schools, and I wish I would have had that opportunity in my own high school. I just think it’s a really good opportunity for kids to have, who wouldn’t have otherwise had, the chance to start until they get to college.”

<h4>
What is special about the Andover Classics Department to you?
</h4>
“It’s kind of like a little club! It’s a pretty tight-knit group of kids, but at the same time, I don’t think it’s exclusive. I think that it’s a pretty welcome group to join.”

<h4>
What is special about Pearson Hall compared to other buildings on campus?
</h4>
“I love Pearson! Something I’ll always remember about Pearson is when the planning was underway to make room for the Tang Institute and Academic Skills, they were going to take over Pearson A, which is the cool room downstairs that has the desk bolted to the floor. It has so much character. The students initiated a real resistance to the idea. I certainly had given up that there was anything I could really do. I love that room. I love all the wrinkles in the floor. It just feels steeped in history, and you can sort of feel all the kids who’ve been at those desks for decades working away at this endeavor, this worthwhile endeavor. There was a petition and the administration listened. They changed their minds, they were flexible, and they came up with a different plan. I’m glad that we’ve been able to keep that room with all its history because to me, it’s such a beautiful room.

Role models inside Andover?
</h4>
“All of my colleagues, and to that list, I have to add David Pottle, who’s retired. I admire how much my colleagues know and how good they are with kids. I appreciate their patience, I appreciate how they hold students to high standards, and I appreciate how they don’t take a snobbish approach to the Classics. I have learned a lot about teaching and a lot about Latin from watching people that I am lucky enough to work with every day here.”

<h4>
Why are classical languages and cultures important today?
</h4>
“They give us a window into an old time that allows insights into current affairs. I think there’s a lot of discipline in learning Latin. I feel like Latin makes you smarter because it makes you have to focus on the details, and I think that’s a skill that matters a lot. It has lots of non-academic applications; it teaches you to be critical.”

“There are lots of opportunities to think about who has a voice and who doesn’t in the Classics and how we as a discipline respond to that. It’s multidisciplinary: you have the art, literature, history, rhetoric, the poetry—so many contemporary pieces are modeled on the ancients. The Classics have had a huge influence on contemporary literature, and it’s sort of fun to look at where that all started.”

<h4>
Who is your favorite ancient figure?
</h4>
“I love Lesbia, and I also love Dido. I think Lesbia’s a good bad guy even though she’s probably not an actual person. She’s a wonderful villain. Dido, I admire because there, Vergil gives us a much more three-dimensional picture of a rich woman character, and she’s just interesting to read. There’s a lot of substance to her. I love to read Cicero because as a Roman and a lawyer, he matches what my interests have been. It’s fun to pick apart his arguments and look at when what he’s saying doesn’t follow or doesn’t make sense or when his arguments work and when they don’t.
