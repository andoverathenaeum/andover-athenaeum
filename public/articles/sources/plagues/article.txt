Panic, misinformation, rampant disease and countless deaths: if you think these are relics from a bygone era, then the COVID-19 pandemic has likely surprised you. Its scale is unprecedented in the modern era, and for several weeks it flung the public into chaos and uncertainty. To the ancients, though, disease was a facet of daily life. Rome in particular was infamous for its widespread morbidity, especially of malaria or ‘Roman fever’ as it became known. Two outbreaks in particular stand out as particularly influential: the Plague of Athens in 430 BCE, an epidemic, which ravaged throughout Athens during the Peloponnesian War, and the Plague of Antonine, beginning in 165 CE, which ravaged throughout most of the Roman empire. The former is described mainly by Thuycidides and the latter by Galen. While these firsthand accounts, which often encourage bloodletting or divine appeasements as possible remedies, certainly demonstrate the progression of modern medicine, they show a reaction to the crisis and the social, political, and economic impact of the plagues which parallels the COVID-19 pandemic.

Over thirty microbial culprits have been identified as possible sources for the Antonine and Athenian Plagues, yet the exact identity of the viruses remains a matter of speculation. Primary accounts of the outbreaks are limited in quantity and often prove unreliable. The Greek historian Thucydides documents the symptoms of the Athenian Plague as such:

<em>People in good health were all of a sudden attacked by violent heats in the head, and redness and inflammation in the eyes. In addition, the inward parts, such as the throat or tongue, becoming bloody and emitting an unnatural and fetid breath. These symptoms were followed by sneezing  and hoarseness, after which the pain soon reached the chest, and produced a hard cough. When it fixed in the stomach, it upset it; and discharges of bile of every kind named by physicians ensued, accompanied by very great distress.</em> (<a href="https://www.livius.org/sources/content/thucydides-historian/the-plague/">https://www.livius.org/sources/content/thucydides-historian/the-plague/</a>)

The account is relatively objectivite, as it avoids characterizing the plague as a divine punishment. Yet, like all documents from a protohistoric era, it must be fully contextualized and analyzed for the potential biases of the writer, only because conflicting accounts have often been lost to time. In this specific case, Thucydides, who was composing an epic retelling of the Peloponnesian War, almost certainly exaggerated or even fabricated some of the symptoms in order to fit the dramatic intensity of his narrative, just as he had exaggerated negative qualities about the Persians. Thucydides writes from an era when history was blurred with legend, yet he is still remarkable among his peers for a commitment to empirical facts as a basis for history. The symptoms of typhoid are largely present among Thucydides' account of the plague. Still, certain details as described by Thucydides, such as the plague’s origin in Africa and infection of scavenger animals, do not align with a typhus diagnosis. Classicists must consider the credibility of Thucydides in coordination with modern scientific and archaeological evidence to form a plausible diagnosis of the disease.

Details about the Antonine Plague are scarce, even though the pandemic emerged at a critical moment in the lifespan of the empire: when Commodus succeeded his father, Marcus Aurelius, and began the gradual decline of the Roman Empire. The onset of this pandemic seems an obvious factor in Rome’s decline, yet some have speculated that the pandemic was largely inconsequential. “The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflicted upon it by the plague which visited it in the reign of Marcus Aurelius,” writes classical historian Barthold Niebuhr (Niebuhr, Lectures on the history of Rome III, Lecture CXXXI (London 1849)). Modern historians, though, have displayed more skepticism over its influence, highlighting the crisis of emperors and nomadic invasions as more influential factors. One reason to doubt the plague’s influence is the relative scarcity of primary accounts outside the writings of Galen. It is notable that Edward Gibbons pays little attention to the plague in his legendary treatise <em>The History of the Fall and Decline of the Roman Empire</em>, as Gibbons provides probably the most exhaustive volume ever written on Rome’s decline. Without a definitive diagnosis, however, it is difficult to estimate the mortality rate or rate of debilitation for such a disease, and so the extent of the plague’s influence may forever remain uncertain.

Yet the lack of a definite answer hasn’t stopped classical historians from conjecturing about the identity and influence of the plague. In fact, the ability to make well-informed inferences about events from antiquity with limited evidence is perhaps the paramount role of a classical historian. Morris Silver, for example, a professor of economics at the City University of New York with a specialization in ancient economies, forms a fascinating economic argument to the identity of the Antonine Plague, citing fiscal grain policy as evidence for an outbreak of bubonic plague. By imposing price-fixing regulations upon the public supply of grain, Silver argues, Roman emperors encouraged their citizens to hoard grain in the face of an unstable market, bringing rats into the city of Rome which then served as carriers for the pestilence. Silver admits himself, however, that the absence of buboes, the quintessential characteristic of bubonic plague, in primary accounts marks a serious flaw in his own hypothesis.

Measles or smallpox seem likely candidates for the Antonine Plague because of the symptoms described by Roman physician Galen, yet modern scientific advancements seem to disprove both. Many animals were alleged by contemporary writers to have been afflicted by this plague, yet animals are famously immune to smallpox (this revelation inspired the invention of the vaccine from the cow, or <em>vacca</em> in Latin). A recent study by Furuse, Suzuki, and Oshitani, which capitalized off the number of mutations within the measles genome, identified the origin of the virus to be as late as the 12th century CE (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20202190">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20202190</a>).  Although the conclusion of the study is still contested, should the study prove correct, it would invalidate the measles hypothesis entirely. In attempting to identify the disease behind these mysterious ancient plagues, there is a remarkable area of interdisciplinary study, encompassing economics, medicine, and history, which so often makes studying the Classics refreshing and exciting.

COVID-19 -- the genome sequence of which was determined mere days after being first discovered -- is not so mysterious as the diseases of antiquity. There is striking similarity, however, in the human responses to each of the crises. The Plague of Athens demonstrated just how closely politics and crisis were intertwined when Pericles, the de facto ruler of Athens during the Peloponnesian War who had caused the spread of disease by encircling his city with a wall for military defense, was forced to defend himself in the streets against the mob. It is no coincidence that <em>Oedipus Rex</em> was first performed in the years following this plague; the driving conflict of Sophocles’s play originates from the king, Oedipus, angering the gods with his sins and thus bringing a plague upon Thebes as divine retribution. The leaders in Athens took several measures in the aftermath of the disease to appease the divines, sometimes importing bizarre foreign rituals and cults into their city to demonstrate their compassion and leadership.

The senators of the Roman Republic were no less ambitious in using the situation for their political gain; in response to plague, they invented a sacrificial festival, the <em>lectisternium</em>, to appease the gods, dedicated a temple to Apollo, and, when all other efforts had failed to halt the plague, imported foreign cults and rituals from Greece and Etruria. In 22 BCE, plague, coupled with flooding and famine, struck Rome, and unsurprisingly, many took to the streets to proclaim that Augustus be appointed dictator to solve the crisis (he was, by this point, dictator in all but name). COVID-19 has also become an intensely political issue in the modern day, as it is human nature to seek figures of authority in response to a heightened sense of danger. The appeal to danger has been a tool of politicians since the days of ancient Rome and Greece, and to that end, a plague is the perfect crisis.

It is fitting that the Antonine Plague occurred under the reign of such a wise emperor as Marcus Aurelius. “Weep not for me; think rather of the pestilence and the deaths of so many others,” uttered the emperor on his deathbed (<a href="https://dailystoic.com/marcus-aurelius-leadership-during-a-pandemic">https://dailystoic.com/marcus-aurelius-leadership-during-a-pandemic</a>).  As the stoic would argue, in the face of calamity, against an insurmountable nature, it is all man can do to remain virtuous and effect what is in his control. Perhaps that is the greatest lesson we can take from antiquity on plagues.
