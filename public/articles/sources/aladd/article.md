#### Axel Ladd ‘20 is a three year senior from Riverside, CT, currently living in Stearns House on campus. He has taken both Latin and Greek classes, and is the co-president of our school’s classics club. We had the chance to interview him to learn more about his interest in the Classics, his experiences at Phillips Academy, and what he plans to do in the future, and here’s what he has to say.

<h4>
After going through Phillips Academy’s Classics program, what did you love and what do you want to change?
</h4>

“My favorite thing about the program is probably how close everyone is; with a small group of teachers and relatively small class size, everyone knows each other, and there certainly is a sense of camaraderie. If I could change one thing it would probably be how the interdisciplinary classics courses work. Basically, within the department there are the base languages, Latin and Greek, and most classes are the different levels of those two languages. There are, however, some courses open to students who do not take Latin or Greek and they are the 410-500 level elective courses. I have always wanted to take these courses as they cover very interesting topics, but my schedule has always been full between taking Latin and Greek and fulfilling my graduation requirements. Talking with the teachers who run these courses, I learned that some of them, Like Mr. Mann’s Women in Antiquity involve quite a bit of writing, even more than I was doing in my senior English electives and I learned that Mr. Mann was attempting to get them listed as Senior English electives because they are already listed as interdisciplinary. I think that moving these courses to not just be CLA/INT but CLA/ENG or CLA/PHR would allow many more interested students like myself to take them and it is something that I would like to see happen in the near future.”

<h4>
What was the best classics-related experience you had at PA?
</h4>

“This is pretty tough because I have had a lot of classes which I enjoyed, but if I were to pin down a specific experience it would probably be last year’s declamation contest. My [CLA 500] class declared a section of Euripides Medea in Attic Greek for our final in front of the whole department, and it is always fun to see all the other classes' declamations.”

<h4>
If you could point to a passage of Latin and/or Greek that moved you, what would it be?
</h4>

"At my old school we read Marcus Aurelius’s meditations in English and I found them impactful, especially his thoughts on finding meaning in life and how to live in the face of the certainty of death. However, if I were asked to point to a specific line of latin or Greek, I would probably point to Catullus’s Odi et Amo. It is a beautiful poem, not just in its meaning, but also in its construction."

<h3>
<b>Favorite Latin Phrases:</b>

<em>
"Semper ubi sub ubi"
</em>
<br/>Translation: Always where under where

<em>
"Tempus fugit cum ludum habes"
</em>
<br/>Translation: Time flies when you are having fun

<b>A Favorite Classical Figure:</b>
<br/>"My favorite figure as of now is Catullus because he always provides an amusing read."
</h3>

<h4>
Did you come into PA with the goal of taking classics courses, or did you become interested after arriving?
</h4>

"Classics is actually part of what drove me to PA. I have taken Latin since 6th grade and I started Greek in 9th grade at my old school. Originally, I was going to go to my local high school because they have a very strong science research program, but I learned that I had already surpassed the level of Latin taught there and there was no Greek offered. My refusal to give up the Classics led me to look at boarding schools, and then I fell in love with Andover."

<h4>
Favorite place in Pearson?
</h4>

"The Pearson Conference room, hands down. Best place to study, take a nap, tutor someone, or just hang out with friends. It has the most comfortable chairs on campus, ample chalkboard space, and is usually pretty quiet."

<h4>
Have you ever had to utilize your knowledge in the classics for something outside of the classics?
</h4>

"All the time. Whenever you are doing nomenclature in science and sometimes even in math, it is usually derived from Latin or Greek. In English I rarely lookup words since the more complicated terms normally come from Latin or Greek. Also just the concepts taught in the Classics are very important, like the organization and table used for Latin grammar can help solve problems in math or science. Additionally, the ideas of fate, the gods, and pietas are important concepts that are not really understood by other teachers."

<h4>
How do you think we can work to make more people interested in the classics?
</h4>

"Awareness. There is a lot of misinformation surrounding the Classics, where people do not understand that it is more than just learning a language. When you take a modern language the focus is on learning to speak Spanish or French, but with Latin and Greek the goal is really to understand a broad spectrum of thought and to learn how they saw and understood the world and how their civilizations have left an impact on our own modern ones. Taking the Classics truly expands the mind to a different form of thought."

<h4>
What is something that could take PA's classics department to the next level?
</h4>

"I think we should hold an event or party for people outside of the classics to come and enjoy some of the aspects of the ancient world. We already do the declamation contest, but that is specifically in department and I think it would help outsiders to learn more about what the Classics are and what it means to learn them."

<h4>
When you first came to PA, what was the state of interest in the classics? Has it changed now? If you've been involved in the classics club, do you think that the club has garnered fresh interest in the classics?
</h4>

"I have been told, and I have observed the fluctuation in class size, where about every other year the size varies from large too small. I happened to be in one of the smaller groups, but the class of 520 kids that will go into 600 is about double our size, so I don’t think the overall department changes that much. I have been involved in the Classics club since I arrived as a new lower. Unfortunately, my lower year the club co-presidents did not put any time into the club, so it fell on the associate board to run everything and most of them were preoccupied so the club was not at the club rally that year, nor did it hold very many meetings. The next year, however, I became one of the club’s co-presidents along with Brian Ko and we were able to sort of restart the club by building up an email list and going to the club rally. We received a lot of help from Gigi Glover and Alexandra LeBaron, so they were made honorary board members. We still struggled with attendance after having lost any members the previous year, but this year we were able to greatly increase the size of the board and increase attendance; I hope this trend continues as the club expands into different areas. As for the club’s effect on new students coming into the department, that is not really our goal. We are mostly looking to spark interest in the field and help that interest to grow into a passion, even if club members do not wish to take the languages."

<h4>
Why are the classics important today?
</h4>

"They help to expand the ways of thinking as well as to be able to fully access the information of ancient scholars, for whom providing just an English translation would be a disservice."

<h4>
How can students not taking classics classes but are interested in the classics also participate in classics-related events and activities?
</h4>

"The Classics Club is certainly open to everyone and we strive to make our meetings accessible and interesting to every level of experience in the world of classics. Also, as mentioned above, there are electives such as Women in Antiquity, Rhetoric, and Etymology, which can be taken by any PA student, no prior Classics knowledge necessary."

<h4>
What will you miss the most about PA (in general, not just Classics)?
</h4>

"The people. Andover has by far the most amazing students and faculty, and they are what really make the school special."

<h4>
Do you plan to pursue anything classics-related in college?
</h4>

"Yes. I definitely plan to major/minor in the classics in college and I would like to continue both in Greek and Latin."
