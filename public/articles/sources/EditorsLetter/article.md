#### Dear Amici (Friends),

<em>Andover Athenaeum</em> first arrived on a windy day in October. As Nakul Iyer ‘20 and I sat at one of the large tables running down the side of the second floor (near the Tang Institute), we discussed the new, ambitious idea that had just run through my head that morning: Phillips Academy’s First Classics Magazine! I attempted to recruit Nakul, a senior about to submit his early college apps, onto a large-scale project that would likely take up an enormous portion of what free time we would have for the remainder of the year. Nonetheless, he agreed! As we discussed our proposal for a small Abbot Grant (to fund printing and software costs), a friend of ours, William Yue ‘22 walked by and overheard our conversation. He sat down, prepared to work on some menial homework assignments, when I told him about our plan. I knew he was a Latin student, and so I had hope that he would be interested in such a proposal. And he was. Our trio, three students from three different grades who had known each other but never worked together before, decided on that October evening to pursue this ambitious project.

We decided to name our magazine <em>Andover Athenaeum</em> (pronounced Athen-EE-um), a name that rolls surprisingly well off the tongue and has its roots in Ancient Rome itself! The Emperor Hadrian founded a school dedicated towards literary and scientific studies in Rome named <em>The Athenaeum</em> (from the Greek city-state of Athens). In recent centuries, <em>Athenaeum</em> has been commonly used in the names of periodicals and literary magazines. perfect representation of the mission and idea of <em>Andover Athenaeum</em>.

<h3>
<em>Athenaeum</em> has two pronunciations!
<br/>Anglicized: Athen-EE-um
<br/>Traditional: Athen-AYE -um
</h3>

After this fortuitous meeting, the rest of the project clicked into place. In November, we filed an Abbot Grant proposal for around nine-hundred dollars, and we proposed the idea to Dr. Meyer, my current Latin 520 teacher, who thereupon agreed to become our faculty advisor! As winter term progressed, we scheduled meetings to recruit new writers, organized the structure of our magazine, and prepared for the printing process. As we entered spring break and went to three different time zones, we still found methods of communicating. Whether it be through our busy Slack channels or email threads, we made sure that <em>Andover Athenaeum</em> continued to move forwards and progress. Because of structured planning and preparation, not even the ill-timed Coronavirus was able to stop this first issue from being released this spring! After nearly seven months of planning, communication, and work, we are finally prepared to present <em><em>Andover Athenaeum</em></em> to the community!

Thank you faculty advisor, Dr. Meyer, for your valuable advice and enthusiastic backing of this project from the very beginning! We hope that, under your guidance, <em>Andover Athenaeum</em> will continue to grow and develop in future issues.

Thank you Ms. Strong and Ms. George for your help and advice while we constructed our Abbot Grant proposal! Our Abbot Grant provided the foundational support for the magazine, allowing us to provide both print and digital versions of the magazine.

Thank you to all of our writers for their hard work through spring break and the early portion of spring term, when the impacts of the Coronavirus were at their peak!

Finally, thank you for joining us on our mission to spread the Classics throughout not only our campus, but also the larger Phillips Academy community as a whole!

I, along with the entire board of <em>Andover Athenaeum</em>, are proud to present to you the first issue of <em>Andover Athenaeum</em>!
