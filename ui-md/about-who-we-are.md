_Andover Athenaeum_ is Phillips Academy’s Classics Magazine. Founded in 2019, this is a place for discussion, creativity, and general awareness of the Classics, both at Phillips Academy and in the world.  

Classics, the study of Ancient Greek and Latin and their respective history, philosophy, and literature, is one of the cornerstones of the Humanities. Its profound impact on areas such as law, politics, and philosophy is clear even in the modern day, more than two millennia later. The works of Homer, Aristotle, Ovid, Virgil, Marcus Aurelius, and countless others have been recreated and referenced in all aspects of the modern world, whether it be literature, architecture, or politics.  

Pearson Hall stands proudly in Phillips Academy’s busiest quadrangle, flanked by its frosh-faced counterparts Morse Hall and Oliver Wendell Holmes Library. It has been the home of Phillips Academy’s Classics Department for over 200 years and recently welcomed the Tang Institute and Academic Skills Center during the OWHL renovation as well. Not many high schools, let alone universities in the world have their own Classics building.  

_Andover Athenaeum_ introduces a novel idea into the Classics ecosystem at Phillips Academy: a magazine. Articles generally cover the following themes: News in the Classics world, both inside and outside of Phillips Academy

*   News in the Classics world, both inside and outside of Phillips Academy
